1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to 
connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the 
future?

You write programs that are maintainable by having a strong structural foundation and understanding how formatting and notations can increase the likelihood of your 
code's longevity. While I think the separate CRUD file was solid for ensuring changes were not made to the files, having multiple files to keep track of and using Jupyter
Notebook was an absolute nightmare. I think if everything were on my own computer I'd have moer luck and would use the CRUD Python modules to complete testing prior to 
further iterating my code!

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other 
client requests?

As a computer scientist I think it's vital to approach each issue you encounter with an open mind and a well rounded strategy that includes both dynamic and static 
testing. If you are able to read through the comments on the code as well I believe you are more likely to have a successful resolution much sooner. My project this
course differed due to the immense weight of using apporto and he relentless issues I had with the server crashing, days where it wouldn't load, and issues with the 
mongo socket connecting.In the future for databases I think ensuring that the data integrity is strong and the authentication and walkthrough process are viable will
make me a great option for future clients.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist utilize a  variety of tactics, data sources, and mathematics to create a vebose and highly visual aspect to understanding data at a "I don't speak 
math" level for a lot of people. Work like this would definitely help me at my current workplace where I oftn utilize Tableau and other databases to pull information and
gather immense amounts of data for my boss and larger corporate teams.
